                                This is a template for the WMU Anime Addicts website. The final 
                                website will appear very much like this prototype (with original
                                artwork/photos and content in place of the placeholders on this 
                                prototype). It will serve as the club's informational hub and 
                                repository of artwork, photos and video.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="faq-instance">
                            <p class="faq-question">Why did you make this site?</p>
                            <p class="faq-answer">
                                The club is rebranding itself and to assist in that effort, 
                                I volunteered to write a website for the club. Content on 
                                the site (specifically the club summary on the home page, the Anime List, and 
                                the Events) are based off an earlier site another member created for the club.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                            <p class="faq-question">Is this the final version of the club website?</p>
                            <p class="faq-answer">
                                Ideally not. I am not assuming there will be at least one club member who 
                                is familar with HTML and CSS every semester, nor am I willing to be the club's 
                                sole content writer indefinitely (seeing as at the time of this site's creation,
                                I will graduate from WMU soon). The official website would have a backend and 
                                CMS to allow club members/officers to edit the site without needing to know 
                                HTML and CSS.
                            </p>

                            <p class="faq-question">
                                After deploying the official site, who should I contact to make changes beyond
                                that which is allowed by a CMS (content management system)?
                            </p>
                            <p class="faq-answer">
                                Assuming there is not a club member who is familar with the site's source code, 
                                I would still be available to make changes if necessary (though my availability 
                                after graduation may be limited). I will provide thorough documentation to the 
                                club officers upon delivery.

                            <p class="faq-answer">
                                As the dictionary would likely have the most content on the site, I left it as 
                                a feature to be developed largely on the backend for the official site.
